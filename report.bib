In previous papers these effects have been discussed rigorously by detailed perturbation analysis. In the present paper a simplified exposition is given of the radiation stresses and some of their consequencies. Physical reasoning, though less rigorous, is used wherever possible. The influence of capillarity on the radiation stresses is fully described for the first time.},

   abstract = {Conventional floating breakwaters are examined and the feasibility of developing a cage floating breakwater is explored. Earlier studies on floating breakwaters reveal that, to achieve a transmission coefficient (Kt) less than 0.5, the breakwater width to wave length ratio (W/L) should necessarily be greater than 0.4 for most of the configurations. Recent studies on cost-effective floating breakwaters indicate that by fixing a row of pipes below the floating body, the W/L requirement can be reduced to 0.15 without any compromise in the performance. This concept has been adopted in developing a new configuration to serve as: (1) a floating breakwater; and (2) as a possible shallow water cage culture unit. Experiments were conducted to study the performance of the cage floating breakwater under wave and wave-current environment. The results on transmission and reflection coefficients are presented and compared with those reported in the literature. The variation of water surface oscillations and velocities within the cage, the effect of mooring line stiffness, and initial tension on transmission characteristics are also discussed.},

   abstract = {Extreme ocean surface waves generated during hurricanes or tsunamis can cause severe damage to coastal communities and infrastructures, especially coastal bridges. In this paper, installation of floating breakwater is proposed to protect coastal bridge decks against strong ocean surface waves. As an environmental-friendly wave-reduction device, floating breakwaters can be easily installed and removed before and after a storm, avoiding impacts on navigation and other coastal operations. To numerically investigate effects of a floating breakwater on the applied hydrodynamic load of a bridge deck under the impact of cnoidal waves, a high-resolution numerical wave tank (NWT) is established using the open-source flow solver REEF3D, which solves the governing equations of the incompressible two-phase flow on a staggered mesh and captures the interface between air and water using a high-resolution level-set method. Effects of prominent parameters, i.e. wave height, water depth, submersion depth, spacing distance and aspect ratio of breakwaters, on the performance of floating breakwater and reducing the hydrodynamic load on a coastal bridge deck are systematically analyzed. It is found that hydrodynamic loads of coastal bridge deck can be greatly reduced through the use of floating breakwaters. Results of this paper can further enhance our understanding on the damage mechanism of coastal bridges under extreme surge waves, and should be instructive for future bridge design.},

The breakwater consists of an upper submerged horizontal porous plate and a lower submerged horizontal solid plate. By means of the matched eigenfunction expansion method, a linear analytical solution is developed for the interaction of water waves with the structure. Then the reflection coefficient, the transmission coefficient, the energy-loss coefficient and the wave forces acting on the plates are calculated. The numerical results obtained for limiting cases are exactly the same as previous predictions for a single submerged horizontal solid plate and a single submerged horizontal porous plate. Numerical results show that with a suitable geometrical porosity of the upper plate, the uplift wave forces on both plates can be controlled at a low level. Numerical results also show that the transmission coefficient will be always small if the dimensionless plate length (plate length versus incident wavelength) exceeds a certain moderate value. This is rather significant for practical engineering, as the incident wavelength varies over a wide range in practice. Moreover, it is found that the hydrodynamic performance of the present structure may be further enhanced if the lower plate is also perforated. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

A three-dimensional hydrodynamic model of the floating body is coupled with a static and dynamic model of the mooring lines, using an iterative procedure. The stiffness coefficients of the mooring lines in six degrees of freedom of the floating breakwater are derived based on the differential changes of mooring lines' tensions caused by the static motions of the floating body. The model of the moored floating system is compared with experimental and numerical results of other investigators. An extensive parametric study is performed to investigate the effect of different configurations (length of mooring lines and draft) on the performance of the moored floating breakwater. The draft of the floating breakwater is changed through the appropriate modification of mooring lines' length. Numerical results demonstrate the effects of the wave characteristics and mooring lines' conditions (slack-taut). The existence of 'optimum' configuration of the moored floating breakwater in terms of wave elevation coefficients and mooring lines' forces is clearly demonstrated, through a decision framework. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

@report{Ruol2012,
   abstract = {Floating breakwaters (FBs) are suited to protect small marinas in mild sea conditions (wave periods up to 4 s and wave heights smaller than 1.5 m). Several companies in the world provide a very effective typology, a concrete rectangular caisson with two vertical plates protruding downwards from the sides. As these shapes resemble a Π, they are referred to as Π-type FBs. In a previous paper, the Authors proposed a new formula for the transmission coefficient based on experiments on six different geometries of this type of FBs, with mass varying from 16 to 76 kg (representing prototypes at different scale, up to 130 tons), all anchored with chains. The formula identifies a key non-dimensional parameter as essential to describe the transmission phenomenon. The aims of this paper are to investigate on the effect of the mooring stiffness, since the degree of restraining on the floating bodies is expected to alter significantly the FB's efficiency. For this purpose, new experiments were recently carried out in a wave flume on FB anchored with piles and tethered with elastic lines, and an exploratory analysis is performed by means of simplified numerical simulations. Based on these investigation, a second non dimensional parameter (d/h, i.e. draft over water depth) is identified as essential to predict whether lower transmission is obtained with a larger or a lower mooring stiffness. Only qualitative predictions are anyway proposed.},

@article{Lo2014,
   abstract = {Wave scattering of a solitary wave traveling over a submerged horizontal plate was studied. Experiments for normal incidence were conducted in a wave flume, with a horizontal plate suspended at two different depths in the middle of the flume. Gauge pressures above and underneath the plate, surface elevations on and near the plate, and flow velocities at three representative fields of view were measured. The flow underneath the plate was found to behave almost like a plug flow, driven by the time-dependent, spatially uniform pressure gradient between the two openings. Complex vortices formed near the two edges of the plate as the plate acted like a flow divider. A numerical model based on two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations was used to confirm the main features captured by the experimental measurements. Analytical solutions based on the linear long wave theory, which admits a soliton-like impulse wave solution, were also derived. The linear theory was applicable for obliquely incident impulse waves. When the analytical solutions were applied to the wave conditions used in the experiments, it was found that the theory described pressure and surface elevation satisfactorily when the nonlinearity was insignificant. Based on the pressure distribution above and beneath the plate, the total vertical force and moment exerted on the plate were calculated. As the wave passed over the plate, the plate first experienced a lift, followed by a force in the downward direction, and then a lift again. As a result, a nonzero time-varying moment existed. The analytical solution was also utilized to examine the effects of relative plate width on the transmitted and reflected waves. The effects of the angle of incidence are also discussed briefly.},

Regarding the FB's hydroelastic response (i.e. 3D displacements of the modules under the wave action), video recording of the horizontal and the vertical displacements of specific points on the FB relatively to some fixed points is implemented, and this response is determined through an appropriate image processing procedure. For assessing the FB's structural response, strain rosettes are utilized, enabling the evaluation of the connectors' forces through the corresponding strains' measurements. The effect of the incident wave characteristics (period, height, obliquity) on the FB's hydroelastic and structural response is analyzed. The correlation between the connectors' forces and the FB's hydroelastic response is extensively discussed. The FB's hydroelastic and structural response depends strongly upon the wave period, while the wave height and obliquity affect this response in the low frequency range. Strong dependency of the connectors' forces upon the existence or not of a FB's intense deformed shape is demonstrated.},

   abstract = {A numerical model is developed based on multidomain boundary element method (MBEM) to investigate the scattering of surface gravity waves by a pair of floating porous boxes. This study reveals that there is a significant reduction in wave forces acting on the boxes with the introduction of structural porosity. Moderate porosity is highly effective for shallow and intermediate water depth for dissipating wave energy, while high porosity is more suitable in case of deep water. A major part of the wave energy is trapped by the porous boxes when the widths of the boxes are close to half of the wavelength of the incident waves. Apart from wave reflection and energy dissipation, a pair of floating porous boxes traps a part of wave energy, which helps in the wave attenuation on the lee side of the porous box. Horizontal and vertical forces of the seaside porous box are 180 deg out of phase, while they are in-phase in case of the box located on the lee side. Optima in the horizontal and vertical forces are attained when the distance between the boxes are at periodic intervals of half the wavelength. This study will be of immense help in the design of box-type porous structures as effective wave barriers for the creation of tranquility zone in the marine environment.},

A viscous fully nonlinear numerical wave tank (NWT) solved by the open source package OpenFOAM is established under laminar flow conditions. After comparing the numerical results with the experimental ones, the well-validated numerical model is further employed to investigate the effects of the length of horizontal bottom-plate (D), the immersion depth of back-plate (d2), the water depth (h) and the wave height (H) on the reflection (Cr) and transmission (Ct) coefficients, dissipation coefficient (Cd) and column-confined energy coefficient (Ce) of the breakwater. The results show that lengthening the bottom-plate can effectively increase the energy dissipation and then lead to lower reflection and transmission coefficients, and a smaller draught of the back-plate can also increase energy dissipation. The water depth has insignificant influence on the hydrodynamic coefficient of long waves, but influences the breakwater performance in short waves. The variation of wave height mainly contributes to the change of reflection coefficient.},

   abstract = {Floating breakwaters are moored structures that attenuate wave energy through a combination of reflection and dissipation. Studies into floating breakwaters have been generally restricted to op-timising the attenuation performance. This study presents a novel floating breakwater that was developed to have good attenuation performance while keeping wave drift loads as small as possible. The floating breakwater was designed as a submerged parabolic beach that enforces wave energy dissipation through breaking. The design was tested in a 3D shallow-water wave basin in captive and moored setups for regular and irregular wave conditions. Results are presented in terms of attenuation performance, motions, and (mooring) loads. The results show that the breaking of waves improves the attenuation performance of the floater in captive setup. However, in moored setup, the attenuation performance was dominated by diffraction and radiation of the wave field, with breaking being of secondary importance. This shows that breaking-enforcing floating breakwaters have potential, but require a high vertical hydrostatic and/or mooring stiffness in order to enforce intense breaking. Mean wave drift loads on the object showed significant difference between breaking and non-breaking waves in both setups, with breaking waves leading to lower normalized loads. This is attributed to breaking-induced setup and set-down of the water level. As a result, the new breakwater design has a more favourable balance between wave attenuation and drift loads than common floating breakwater designs. Tests with varying surface roughness showed that floating breakwaters may benefit from dual-use functions that naturally increase the roughness (e.g., shellfish, vegetation), which have a marginal effect on the attenuation performance , but increase the added mass and hydrodynamic damping and as such, reduce mooring line loads.},

@article{Othmer2014,
   abstract = {The adjoint method has long been considered as the tool of choice for gradient-based optimisation in computational fluid dynamics (CFD). It is the independence of the computational cost from the number of design variables that makes it particularly attractive for problems with large design spaces. Originally developed by Lions and Pironneau in the 70's, the adjoint method has evolved towards a standard tool within the development processes of the aeronautical industries. Its uptake in the automotive industry, however, lags behind. The first systematic applications of adjoint methods in automotive CFD have interestingly not taken place in the classical shape design arena, but in a relatively young discipline of sensitivity-based optimisation: fluid dynamic topology optimisation. While being an established concept in structure mechanics for decades already, its transfer to fluid dynamics took place just ten years ago. We demonstrate that specifically for ducted flow applications, like airducts for cabin ventilation or engine intake ports, it constitutes a very powerful tool and has matured over the last years to a level that allows its systematic usage for various automotive applications. To drive adjoint-based shape optimisation to the same degree of maturity and robustness for car applications is the subject of ongoing research collaborations between academia and the car industry. Achievements and challenges encountered during these efforts are presented. 1 Background Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is a central element of the automotive development process. Besides the classical external aerodynamics for the prediction of drag and lift coefficients, there is a whole plethora of applications for ducted flows: airducts for cabin ventilation, engine intake ports, exhaust systems including catalytic converters, air intakes, water jackets of cylinder heads, cooling plates for electric vehicle battery packs and many more (Figure ). The standard procedure of developing these parts still consists of manual iteration loops between designer and computational engineer, and automatic optimisation methods are being used systematically only for some selected CFD applications (e.g. for airducts, Figure ). Via an automatic process chain consisting of a CAD (Computer-Aided Design) system, meshing software, CFD solver and post-processor a black-box optimisation algorithm, typically of the evolutionary strategy type, is employed to drive a parameterised CAD-model into an optimal state. Due to the high computational effort associated with black-box optimisation, where the number of CFD evaluations scales roughly linearly with the number of design variables, the explorable design space is very limited: In our current practice, these methods cannot afford more than ten design parameters.

   abstract = {The industrial aerodynamic design of helicopter rotor blades needs to consider simultaneously the two typical flight conditions of hover and forward flight. In the present work this multi-objective design problem is tackled using a genetic algorithm, coupled to rotor performance simulation tools. The turn-around time of an optimization loop is acceptable in an industrial design loop when using low-cost, low-fidelity tools such as the comprehensive rotorcraft code HOST, but becomes excessively high when employing high-fidelity models like CFD methods. To incorporate high-fidelity models into the optimization loop while maintaining a moderate computational cost, a Multi-Fidelity Optimization (MFO) strategy is proposed: as a preliminary step, a HOST-based genetic algorithm optimization is used to reduce the parameter space and select a set of blade geometries used to initialize the high-fidelity stage. Secondly, the selected blades are re-evaluated by CFD and used to construct a high-fidelity surrogate model. Finally, a Surrogate Based Optimization (SBO) is carried out and the Pareto optimal individuals according to the SBO are recomputed by CFD for final performance evaluation. The proposed strategy is validated step by step. It is shown that an industrially acceptable number of CFD-simulations is sufficient to obtain blade designs with significantly higher performances than the baseline and SBO results issued from a standard Latin-Hypercube-Sampling initialization. The proposed MFO strategy represents an efficient method for the simultaneous optimization of rotor blade geometries in hover and forward flight.},

Reinforcement learning is applied to extract the optimization experience from the semi-empirical method DATCOM using deep neural networks. Transfer learning is implemented to reuse the experience as priori knowledge in the CFD-based optimization by sharing neural network parameters. For the considered aerodynamic shape optimization problem of missile control surfaces, a remarkable reduction in the computational time has been accomplished. The new approach significantly decreases the required CFD calls by over 62.5%. Meanwhile, the time spent in the experience extraction and parameter transfer process is negligible.},

   abstract = {Owing to the fast development in the energy field, the demands are increasing to improve energy efficiency of wind turbine. In order to produce more efficient, sustainable-clean energy, accurate prediction of wind turbine design parameters provide to work the system efficiency at the maximum level. So, many research to determine wind turbine characteristics have been conducted by the researchers with different methods: theoretical analysis, experiment, numerical simulation. One of the main research subjects of wind turbines is blades. The wind blades are considered as the most important and expensive part in the wind turbine. The design optimization of the blades is the most important stage to maximize efficiency production. Aerodynamic characteristics of the blades are critical components that have a large influence on the performance of the turbine. So, the authors built an optimal model of aerodynamic characteristics through maximizing lift coefficient (Cl) and the lift to drag ratio. The lift to drag ratio is used to express the relation between lift and drag, it is determined by dividing the Clby the drag coefficient (Cd). This value can be maximized by optimizing the blade shape. In this paper, a method of optimizing shape by combining computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and genetic algorithms (GA) is presented. Firstly, an S809 airfoil which is frequently used in wind turbines will be selected as the initial shape by a list of control points and then the lift and drag coefficients of this airfoil were determined using CFD. Next, the shape of the airfoil will be automatically changed by moving the control point through the GA method by Dakota (Design and Analysis toolKit for Optimization and Terascale Applications) software. The final shape that the lift to drag ratio for the optimal value will be found through a number of loops. The simulation results were validated by comparison with articles of Agarwal. [1] and Ritlop [3]. The main contribution of this paper is that the optimal model for predicting aerodynamic characteristics is built. Furthermore, the present study also points out the possible further research directions of optimizing the wind turbine so as to help researchers in the field develop more effective wind turbine designs according to geographical conditions and user needs at Viet Nam.},

   abstract = {A wind farm layout optimization framework based on a multi-fidelity optimization approach is applied to the offshore test case of Middelgrunden, Denmark as well as to the onshore test case of Stag Holt - Coldham wind farm, UK. While aesthetic considerations have heavily influenced the famous curved design of the Middelgrunden wind farm, this work focuses on demonstrating a method that optimizes the profit of wind farms over their lifetime based on a balance of the energy production income, the electrical grid costs, the foundations cost, and the cost of wake turbulence induced fatigue degradation of different wind turbine components. A multi-fidelity concept is adapted, which uses cost function models of increasing complexity (and decreasing speed) to accelerate the convergence to an optimum solution. In the EU-FP6 TOPFARM project, three levels of complexity are considered. The first level uses a simple stationary wind farm wake model to estimate the Annual Energy Production (AEP), a foundations cost model depending on the water depth and an electrical grid cost function dictated by cable length. The second level calculates the AEP and adds a wake-induced fatigue degradation cost function on the basis of the interpolation in a database of simulations performed for various wind speeds and wake setups with the aero-elastic code HAWC2 and the dynamic wake meandering model. The third level, not considered in this present paper, includes directly the HAWC2 and the dynamic wake meandering model in the optimization loop in order to estimate both the fatigue costs and the AEP. The novelty of this work is the implementation of the multi-fidelity approach in the context of wind farm optimization, the inclusion of the fatigue degradation costs in the optimization framework, and its application on the optimal performance as seen through an economical perspective.},

   abstract = {Increasing demands on engine power to meet increased load carrying capacity and adherence to emission norms have necessitated the need to improve thermal management system of the vehicle. The efficiency of the vehicle cooling system strongly depends on the fan and fan-shroud design and, designing an optimum fan and fan-shroud has been a challenge for the designer. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) techniques are being increasingly used to perform virtual tests to predict and optimize the performance of fan and fan-shroud assembly. However, these CFD based optimization are mostly based on a single performance parameter. In addition, the sequential choice of input parameters in such optimization exercise leads to a large number of CFD simulations that are required to optimize the performance over the complete range of design and operating envelope. As a result, the optimization is carried out over a limited range of design and operating envelope only. In this paper, a Design of Experiments (DoE) based CFD approach has been used to optimize the fan and fan-shroud design of a cooling pack system. The input design variables of Fan Immersion ratio, Fan to Core distance and Shroud Chamfer Length ratio were considered in this study. The performance output variables of mass flow rate, fan power, and velocity uniformity in the radiator core were predicted. The Central Composite Design (CCD) based DoE approach was used to design the layout of the CFD simulations with the goal of maximizing airflow through the fan, minimize the fan power requirement, and maximize the velocity uniformity in the radiator core. The results from these designed set of CFD simulations were used to generate a response surface that linked the input and output variables with a 2nd order accuracy transfer function which was then used to optimize the fan and fan-shroud design.

   abstract = {In a recent paper Gresho and Sani' showed that Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions for the pressure Poisson equation give the same solution. The purpose of this paper is to confirm this (for one case at least) by numerically solving the pressure equation with Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions for the inviscid stagnation point flow problem. The Dirichlet boundary condition is obtained by integrating the tangential component of the momentum equation along the boundary. The Neumann boundary condition is obtained by applying the normal component of the momentum equation at the boundary. In this work solutions for the Neumann problem exist only if a compatibility condition is satisfied. A consistent finite difference procedure which satisfies this condition on non-staggered grids is used for the solution of the pressure equation with Neumann conditions. Two test cases are computed. In the first case the velocity field is given from the analytical solution and the pressure is recovered from the solution of the associated Poisson equation. The computed results are identical for both Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. However, the Dirichlet problem converges faster than the Neumann case. In the second test case the velocity field is computed from the momentum equations, which are solved iteratively with the pressure Poisson equation. In this case the Neumann problem converges faster than the Dirichlet problem.},

   abstract = {The boundaries of numerical domains for free-surface wave simulations with marine structures generate spurious wave reflection if no special measures are taken to prevent it. The common way to prevent reflection is to use dissipation zones at the cost of increased computational effort. On many occasions, the size of the dissipation area is considerably larger than the area of interest where wave interaction with the structure takes place. Our objective is to derive a local absorbing boundary condition that has equal performance to a dissipation zone with lower computational cost. The boundary condition is designed for irregular free-surface wave simulations in numerical methods that resolve the vertical dimension with multiple cells. It is for a range of phase velocities, meaning that the reflection coefficient per wave component is lower than a chosen value, say 2\%, over a range of values for the dimensionless wave number kh. This is accomplished by extending the Sommerfeld boundary condition with an approximation of the linear dispersion relation in terms of kh, in combination with vertical derivatives of the solution variables. For this article, the boundary condition is extended with a non-zero right-hand side in order to prevent wave reflection, while, at the same time, at the same boundary, generating waves that propagate into the domain. Results of irregular wave simulations are shown to correspond to the analytical reflection coefficient for a range of wave numbers, and to have similar performance to a dissipation zone at a lower cost.},

   abstract = {During the design of a Gravity-Base Structure (GBS) for harsh environments, it is essential to account for the maximum wave run-up in operational and extreme weather conditions. Linear diffraction theory and empirical correction factors are typically used in the early design phase of a project in which wave run-up is a concern. As the project nears final design, model tests are usually used to assess wave run-up and air gap requirements. This paper addresses the use of alternative methods for prediction of run-up around a GBS in approximately 100 m water depth. Results from a second-order diffraction code (WAM1T) and a fully nonlinear CFD program (ComFLOW) are compared to assess the importance of nonlinearities, which are shown to depend on incident wave steepness and wavelength. Extending diffraction theory to second-order significantly improves linear predictions and produces more realistic spatial patterns of maximum run-up. However CFD simulations are required to accurately predict run-up associated with very steep incident waves and highly nonlinear characteristics. In addition to regular wave computations, linear and second-order potential flow calculations are also compared against model test results for an irregular sea. Copyright © 2008 by ASME.},

   abstract = {Sloshing dynamics in LNG tanks was studied by carrying out numerical simulations. The applied CFD code ComFLOW solved the Navier-Stokes equations and used an improved Volume-of-Fluid (iVOF) method to track the movement of the free surface. Application of two different fluid models, single-phase (only liquid) and two-phase (liquid and a compressible gas), was presented. For single-phase simulations, the SOR method was applied to solve the pressure field, while the BiCGSTAB pressure solver was used in case of two-phase simulations. The fluid flow was more complex for the higher 70\% filling ratio cases than for the 20\% filling ratio cases. In case of a low filling ratio, it was sufficient to model only the flow in the liquid phase. The case of a high filling ratio of 70\% was more demanding for numerical simulation due to the more complex flow features. For this case, an efficient alternative was to simulate two-phase flow. To prevent numerically-induced pressure spikes, a peak-removal and smoothing technique was applied. This method did not smoothen out the truly existing flow features, but rather cut away pressure spikes and improved the legibility of pressure signals. As expected, peak pressure values increased for increasing tank filling ratio and higher tank motion amplitudes. This is an abstract of a paper presented at the Nineteenth (2009) International Offshore and Polar Engineering Conference Proceedings (Osaka, Japan 6/21-26/2009).},

   abstract = {The paper presents an industrial application of CFD and non-linear structural response codes in offshore technology. A Wave-In-Deck load due to an extreme wave, acting on a jacket platform, is studied numerically. Particular attention is given to details of local flow and local non-linear dynamical response of the structure. A very detailed FEM model of the platform deck structure, composed of shell elements, is embedded into a non body-conforming CFD grid of computational cells. The applied CFD code is a Navier-Stokes equation solver with an improved Volume of Fluid (iVOF) method employed to displace and re-construct fluid's free surface and uses a simple, Cartesian grid. The two computational grids, FEM and CFD, are independent. The challenge of a direct mapping of CFD-derived fluid pressures onto structural FEM shell elements is addressed. Then the non-linear dynamical response of the structure is found in time domain. The employed CFD code is ComFLOW while the FEM part is handled by the well-known commercial program LS-DYNA. The composed approach utilizes both robustness of VOF-based methods in tracking of the fluid's free surface and reliability of FEM structural codes such as LS-DYNA. Copyright © 2009 by ASME.},

   abstract = {ComFLOW is a 3D Volume-of-Fluid (VOF) model to solve the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations including free surface, or to solve the Navier-Stokes equations for two-phase flow problems (two-phase flow: both an incompressible viscous fluid (e.g., water) and a compressible viscous fluid (e.g., air) are present). The problem statement of the present study reads: 'Is ComFLOW capable of accurate prediction of wave impacts on (impermeable) coastal structures such as dikes? And, if so, what are the preferred model settings and associated computing times?'. In this paper, ComFLOW is validated for this purpose by comparison against pressure data as measured in the Delta flume by pressure sensors at dikes. We have selected three different experiments, with typical dike geometries (slope 1:3.5, with and without berm) at which more than 20 pressure sensors were installed. The results can be summarized as follows. The pressure measurements are reproduced well in the simulations. A grid with about 170 grid cells per wave length in the horizontal, and between 4 and 6 grid cells per wave height in the vertical, proves to be sufficiently fine. At such a grid resolution and with about 450 by 35 grid cells in the computational domain, a typical CPU time is 35 minutes for simulations with a model time of 10 wave periods. For the present application, it is preferable to use the one-phase flow model rather than the two-phase flow model, since the former gives better results in the lower located pressure sensors and consumes less CPU time.},

   abstract = {The Catenary Anchor-Leg Mooring (CALM) is the most popular and widely-used type of offshore loading terminal. A CALM buoy consists of a floating buoy anchored to the seabed by catenary chain legs which are secured to anchors or piles. Due to the small inertia of CALM buoys, the mooring line responses are very sensitive to waves and considerable fatigue risk is introduced to the mooring lines. Extreme waves may even lead to mooring line failure. Therefore it is highly relevant to study the motions of the CALM buoy in (extreme) wave conditions. This paper presents a validation study of a coupled CFD - dynamic mooring model for simulating the response of a shallow water CALM buoy in extreme waves (Figure 1). Simulations of an interactively moving CALM buoy in a horizontal mooring system were performed by coupling a Navier-Stokes based finite-volume, VoF CFD solver with a dynamic mooring model. The CFD results are validated against model tests performed in MARIN's shallow-water basin during the ComFLOW-2 joint industry project. The validation study concentrates on the correct prediction of the coupled responses of the CALM buoy in extreme, regular shallow-water waves. As an alternative to simulations with a fully coupled dynamic mooring set-up, also CFD simulations are presented in which the mooring system is represented by a linearly equivalent spring matrix, including cross terms. The importance of correctly modelling these cross terms is presented in the paper, and the results obtained with- and without these off-diagonal spring terms are compared.},

   abstract = {A numerical simulation is performed to study the velocity, streamlines, vorticity and shear stress distributions in viscous water waves with different wave steepness in intermediate and deep water depth when the average wind velocity is zero. The numerical results present evidence of clockwise and anticlockwise rotation of the fluid at the trough and crest of the water waves. These results show thicker vorticity layers near the surface of water wave than that predicted by the theories of inviscid rotational flow and the low Reynolds number viscous flow. Moreover, the magnitude of vorticity near the free surface is much larger than that predicted by these theories. The analysis of the shear stress under water waves show a thick shear layer near the water surface where large shear stress exists. Negative and positive shear stresses are observed near the surface below the crest and trough of the waves, while the maximum positive shear stress is inside the water and below the crest of the water wave. Comparison of wave energy decay rate in intermediate depth and deep water waves with laboratory and theoretical results are also presented. © 2009 Copyright Cambridge University Press.},

Two simultaneous wave records are taken at adjacent locations, and all the amplitudes of Fourier components are analyzed by the FFT technique. The amplitudes of incident and reflected wave components are estimated from the Fourier components, and the incident and reflected wave spectra are constructed by smoothing the estimated periodograms. The wave resolution is effective in the range outside the condition of the gauge spacing being even integer of half wavelength. The ratio of incident and reflected wave energies in the effective resolution range is employed in estimating the overall reflection coefficient. The incident and reflected wave heights are estimated from the composite wave heights by energy consideration.},

@article{breakerbarexperiment,
   abstract = {A large-scale wave flume experiment has been carried out involving a T = 4 s regular wave with H = 0.85 m wave height plunging over a fixed barred beach profile. Velocity profiles were measured at 12 locations along the breaker bar using LDA and ADV. A strong undertow is generated reaching magnitudes of 0.8 m/s on the shoreward side of the breaker bar. A circulation pattern occurs between the breaking area and the inner surf zone. Time-averaged turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) is largest in the breaking area on the shoreward side of the bar where the plunging jet penetrates the water column. At this location, and on the bar crest, TKE generated at the water surface in the breaking process reaches the bottom boundary layer. In the breaking area, TKE does not reduce to zero within a wave cycle which leads to a high level of “residual” turbulence and therefore lower temporal variation in TKE compared to previous studies of breaking waves on plane beach slopes. It is argued that this residual turbulence results from the breaker bar-trough geometry, which enables larger length scales and time scales of breaking-generated vortices and which enhances turbulence production within the water column compared to plane beaches. Transport of TKE is dominated by the undertow-related flux, whereas the wave-related and turbulent fluxes are approximately an order of magnitude smaller. Turbulence production and dissipation are largest in the breaker zone and of similar magnitude, but in the shoaling zone and inner surf zone production is negligible and dissipation dominates.},
